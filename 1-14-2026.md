# Today's notes

Advanced Database Systems
- This could bethe better way to write our notes to be honest.
- I am trying to understand what the hell kind of autocomplete it has going on right now.
    - Way too much going on in this autocomplete.

- I will find out how to solve the autocomplete problem that I really do not enjoy all that much at another date. 
    - I think that it is probably a better idea just to use the note taking in a way that I am already this will allow me to get the flow going already.
    - I don't really enjoy all of the typing noises I make a lot of the time ~~
