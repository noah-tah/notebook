# Notes to Self

Today I need to finish my spreadsheet modeling, complete my enrollment, and I need to finish my fasfa for this year so that I can get everything in line for the Tribal enrollment form. That way I have all my ducks in a row and have my homework in at the same time. That way I can be in the best position i can be for the current future.

It would be good to also take care of the payments that are getting declined on the wife's card so that I can get my obsidian synced up. 



I also forgot about the ebarassing moment on the table where my voice cracked that was really bad

Yeah my fucking bad I need to figure out how to not only love spreadsheets but also i need to learn to love learning how to fucking type.

it is entirely possible that I do not want to ever use something that isn't linux for work because this is so much better it is actually insane

just run everything in the fucking browser dude
# Beef-Up Ranch (BUR)
- Topeka, Kansas
- Tulsa, Oklahoma

Contains different levels of four key nutrients, and can be made by blending three different feeds together.

Cows should not be fed more than twice the minimum requirement for any nutrient each month.


What are our fucking constraints?
- The minimum requirement
So now we got our fucking minimum requirements so now we need to fucking move on to the next constraint.





I think i might actually be done with that assignment I am going to verify with deepseek to see what they think of what i did

# Video Game Studies Assignment 10

This is a short opinion piece assignment. I expect more than 2 sentences as an answer but there is no minimum length. Give good content for grade.


What game is more influential, Street Fighter 2 or Mortal Kombat?


This assignment is due

November 23rd





 mean i have so much of my homeowrk done it is hard for me to find shit to fucking do and i am not exactly fucking thrilled to do like boot.dev so i guess i will just pay attention in class for now
yeah neverind fuck that table builshit








# Software Acquisition

- To effectively assess the total cost of ownership (TCO) for each development option, use tools to develop a comprehensive spreadsheet
	- Enhance the spreadsheet by incorporation graphical charts that visually represent the results
- In addition to upfront costs of software acquisition, it is vital to consider user support issues
	- A supplemental maintenance agreement might be considered when purchasing a software package
- The systems analyst should now prepare a comprehensive acquisition recommendation report
- the report should include the following:
	- An evaluation and description of each acquisition alternative
	- Give details of each option with a precise analysis of advantages and disadvantages
	- When applicable, use visuals like charts or graphs to illustrate complex data or comparisons
- For the oral presentation, the analyst should use clear communication


Chapter 11 in Systems analysis and design
	I already finished the assignment for this one

- Quality assurance is an ongoing process that starts from the initial stages of systems development and continues through its life cycle.
- The primary object of QA is to prevent problems in the first place or to identify them as early as possible.
- the steps include the following:
	- requirements analysis to ensure the system meets designed needs
	- careful design to prevent architectural and interface problems
	- diligent coding practices to avoid errors


Software engineering is a structured and systematic approach to developing software

The following are primary activity areas of software engineering
	- requirements - functions of software are identified
	- design -- involves planning software architecture and interfaces
	- construction -- coding and building the software
	- testing -- software is rigorously evaluated
	- - maintenence and evolutions









Let’s break it down **simply and clearly**, because Boots was giving hints but not making it obvious.

# ✅ Key Concepts You Need

### **1. Who sets the private `__name`?**

The **Human** class sets `__name`:

```python
class Human:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.__name = name
```

So when you make an Archer, **Human must set the name**, not Archer.

That means:

### 👉 Archer must call `super().__init__(name)`

**and pass the _parameter_ `name`**, not `self.__name`.

---

# ❗ Why can't Archer use `self.__name`?

Because of **name-mangling**.

Inside Human:

- `__name` becomes `_Human__name`
    

Inside Archer:

- `__name` becomes `_Archer__name`
    

These are NOT the same variable.

So:  
➡️ Archer CANNOT access or set `__name` for Human  
➡️ Archer must send the plain parameter `name` into the parent constructor

---

# ❗ What was wrong with your original line?

You wrote:

```python
super().__init__(name, self.__num_arrows)
```

❌ Human’s constructor only takes **1 argument**  
❌ `self.__num_arrows` does NOT exist yet  
❌ Even if it did, it would be `_Archer__num_arrows`, not `_Human__num_arrows`

---

# ✅ Correct Solution (Simple)

```python
class Archer(Human):
    def __init__(self, name, num_arrows):
        super().__init__(name)          # Call Human's constructor
        self.__num_arrows = num_arrows  # Set Archer's private variable

    def get_num_arrows(self):
        return self.__num_arrows
```

---

# 👍 Why this works

### ✔ `super().__init__(name)`

Calls Human’s constructor → sets `_Human__name`

### ✔ `self.__num_arrows = num_arrows`

Creates `_Archer__num_arrows` privately for Archer

### ✔ `get_num_arrows()`

Returns the private arrows value correctly

---

# If you want a simple analogy

**Human initializes name. Archer initializes arrows.**  
You don’t try to give Human your arrows — that’s Archer’s job.

---

# If anything is still confusing, tell me which part feels the weirdest. I can re-explain it visually or step-by-step.



























Yes — you’ve almost got it.  
Let me restate it cleanly so you can be **100% sure**.

---

# ✅ Step-by-step: What actually exists in memory?

### **1. Python creates an empty Archer object**

Before _any_ initializer runs, Python allocates memory for:

```
<Archer object at 0x...>
```

It is NOT fully set up yet.  
It exists — but it has **no attributes** yet.

---

# ✅ 2. Python calls Archer.**init**(self, name, num_arrows)

Now we are inside Archer’s constructor.

At this moment:

- The **Archer object exists** in memory
    
- But it does **NOT** have `_Human__name`
    
- And does **NOT** have `_Archer__num_arrows`
    
- It’s just an empty box ready to be filled
    

---

# ✅ 3. Archer calls: `super().__init__(name)`

This does **NOT** create a Human object.

It means:

> “Run the **Human initializer** on THIS SAME Archer object.”

So this line:

```python
self.__name = name
```

inside Human sets:

```
_Human__name = name
```

ON THE ARCHER.

The Archer now contains:

```
Archer object {
    _Human__name: "<the name>"
}
```

This is the **Human part** of the Archer.

---

# ❗ Important Clarification

You said:

> "the human already exists in memory at this point"

Let’s correct that slightly:

### ✔ The **Archer exists** in memory

### ✔ The Archer will contain Human’s attributes

### ❌ But a **separate Human object** does NOT exist

There is **ONE** object — an Archer — being partially initialized by Human’s constructor.

---

# ✅ 4. Archer now sets its own private field

```python
self.__num_arrows = num_arrows
```

Which becomes:

```
_Archer__num_arrows = num_arrows
```

So the object in memory finally looks like:

```
Archer object {
    _Human__name: "Robin",
    _Archer__num_arrows: 50
}
```

---

# 🎯 Your conclusion (rewritten correctly)

> We already have an Archer object in memory.  
> `super().__init__(name)` uses Human’s constructor to initialize the Human part of the Archer object (specifically `_Human__name`).  
> Then Archer initializes its own private state (`_Archer__num_arrows`).  
> We pass the parameter `name` because Human is responsible for creating the private name variable.

✔ That is 100% correct.

---

If you want, I can draw a picture showing exactly what the object looks like in memory before and after each step — that usually makes it _click permanently_.
