I actually really enjoy having a calendar with all of my classes on them. I also went ahead and put meeting ids on there and everything which makes me feel a lot more secure with it. I don't use any of the Apple applications because I am a windows and linux user so I should probably just stick with Google Calendar. Who really cares if they have my data dude at this point haha. I don't want to handwrite. I don't necessarily want to program my own calendar, and I don't exactly want to use Notion or some random calendar app. Perhaps programming my own in the future would actually be pretty damn useful but you would have to make it into a phone application AND a web application
