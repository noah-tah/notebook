Now we are writing in our notebook and it will be synced across both windows and linux and i wont have to worry about it anymore which is really nice. I won't be able to sync it with my iphone though but why would i need to to be honest. I really don't use my iphone for stuff like that and I just use outlook which handles all of my emails and then if i get an email client that is similar on linux then i can handle my emails on all of my computing devices

now i don't have to worry about how i am going to take notes anymore and i can just express myself in my notebook without disturbing or using paper or wastefulness at all.


Now i have a new note and i  am writing some more stuff and so now i should be seeing that the obsidian on the other side is pulling this change? 

So now I am going to make some more changes to the note and we will see if this transfers over to the linux machine with n
