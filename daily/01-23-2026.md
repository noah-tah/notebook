I think the method of productivity is to program and watch naruto at the same time. It gives me something that makes me look forward to programming and motivating at the same time without being novel.


sometimes it is best just to hold your language back a little bit because you don't need to reveal everything to everyone that is basically what I think.

so now the note taking app is fixed now what?:

- [ ] Finish packing up our stuff
- [ ] Start working on the app we already started
- [ ] Program something new and fun i am excited about
	- [ ] Some form of AI video producer?
- [ ] Nap
- [ ] Check to see if I am signed up for my classes yet with the textbook and stuff
- [ ] Watch a data analytics video
- [ ] Try tablaeu?
- [ ] Install git on WSL so i can back up what I already have on git
- [ ] Go to work
- [ ] Charge Phone
- [ ] Brush Teeth
- [ ] Do Jeremy and our laundry

See how useful it is  for you to make lists of stuff that you need to do? Now you can go execute and come back and check off of the list. You also need to focus on typing more accurately instead of typing so quickly so that you can improve at your typing speed. I need to be able to type at the speed of my thought. 

Light mode is the way also. Dark mode makes me unfocused.
