I think the move is definitely to stick with cursor and agent mode and just go with the path of least resistance when it comes to programming because it will keep me coming back for more. I think that my morals constantly pushing me to understand the code that is being generated will mostly keep me in check

the way that tailwind mobile-first design works is that we will start with the base styles as mobile and then there are style prefixes we can use like `sm:` or `md:` or `lg:` or `xl` or `2xl` and these are different breakpoint that we can use to make sure our website is as responsible as possible.

coming back it seems like programming is a lot more fun when i am reviewing the changes and learning how to build the full application so if i can offload a lot of the basic styling to ai that is great and i can just worry about the structure of the page and if it meets my requirements.

Now that we have the basic interface complete for the application it begs to wonder where we approach the application next we shold probably figure out where the back button will go


back -> what screen goes here

new -> go to a new application screen

# Top of the page
Back (Create New Application ) Finish

# Stuff that needs filled
Company name
Position
Application Status
Date Applied
Link to Job URL
Notes about Job Application/Hiring process

# Other stuff that needs to be built at some point
- Update should actually utilize our api service layer we build and should update the application
- Our delete should do that as well

- We can actually check our code to see if this functionality is already built in at this point
	- Yeah both of them are in fact already implemented in the current code in
