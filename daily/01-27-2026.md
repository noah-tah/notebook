Is it better to work without any distractions or is it better to play music while i learn to program?
Is it better that I program in the morning or at night?
Is it better that I program while drinking coffee, or while drinking water only?
Is it better that I take a day off of programming, or to do it every day?
Should I switch between QWERTY and DVORAK when programming?

None of these questions are doing anything for us. They do not serve us. We are thinking these things to avoid the text editor. When we can sit down and be honest without ourselves and reflect on why we are avoiding the text editor we can sooner enter it and become the person we dream of becoming. Then perhaps we will stop craving the joy of locking in Viktor mid lane


I think that you should stop using vim motions in things that are not vim. You are setting yourself up for disappointment because nothing other than VIM will be VIM and you are chasing a programming dragon that can never be achieved with the tools you are trying to achieve it with. If you wanna do the vim motion thing, just use vim.
