So i have to get car insurance but i have an overdue balance with progressive that I do not want to pay because I would rather maximize the money I have now so that I can begin saving. It will be okay to take the credit hit for now because in the long run I will pay all of these things. I will have to keep track of these overdue items in a spreadsheet, so that I can take care of them when the cash begins flowing.



I want to cancel the line on my account that me and my wife share. 
The phone number I want to cancel is
	580-485-6517

Expecting a phone call back from the utility company. I just want to make sure if I do not make this payment, am I going to be disconnected, and how long do I have until I am disconnected?



So we want to optimize the amount of money that we have left. We need to pay the rent and we need to pay the utilities and the phone bill probably. We don't want random subscriptions and bills coming out of the money that we need to sustain us. By moving it to the savings account we will make sure we only spend the money that we want to spend. We can leave less than 100 dollars in the account which will allow us to have spending money if we need something while we are out. We will only pay a bill if we absolutely have to, conserving the money that we have. (Perhaps we even withdraw the money that is less than 100 so that HULU bundle doesn't get taken out.)
