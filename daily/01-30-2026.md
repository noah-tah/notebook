So i have to get car insurance but i have an overdue balance with progressive that I do not want to pay because I would rather maximize the money I have now so that I can begin saving. It will be okay to take the credit hit for now because in the long run I will pay all of these things. I will have to keep track of these overdue items in a spreadsheet, so that I can take care of them when the cash begins flowing.



I want to cancel the line on my account that me and my wife share. 
The phone number I want to cancel is
	580-485-6517

Expecting a phone call back from the utility company. I just want to make sure if I do not make this payment, am I going to be disconnected, and how long do I have until I am disconnected?
