		- registering for a course
		- making a deposit into a checking account.

transactions contain many steps
	updating a customers account
	adjusting product inventory
	updating seller's accounts receivable


all parts of a transaction must be successfully completed to prevent data integrity problems
	therefore executing and managing transactions are important database system activities


atomicity
consistency
isolation
durability


transaction properties

importance of serializability
	ensures concurrent transactions maintain consistency and integrity

sql and represent transactions
	transaction logs can ensure the DMBS's ability to recover transactions.

When many transactions take place at the same time
	called concurrent transactions


managing the execution of such transactions is called concurrency control

problems that can occur with concurrent transactions
	lost updates
	uncommitted data
	inconsistent retrievals


most common algorithms for concurrency control
	locks
	time stamping
	optimistic methods


database recovery management can ensure that a databases contents are restored to a valid consistent state in case of a hardware or software failure
