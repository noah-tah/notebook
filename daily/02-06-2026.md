ACID

Atomicity
    Transactions must be completed every time, and no partials are accepted. If for some reason there is a crash or a loss in connection, the database will be rolled back to its previous state, maintaining data integrity
Consistency
    Transactions will move database from one state which is respecting all constraints and business rules to a new state that still reflects the same rules and constraints.
Isolation
    All datums can only be accessed by one concurrent transaction at a time if that transaction will harm the integrity of the first transaction.
Durability
    All data on the database is persistent and even in a result of a crash the data will remain. Once and transaction is completed and the change is applied to the database, it is permanent.



Artificial intelligence is software that learns. Wow.
