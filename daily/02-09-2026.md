Obsidian has been a nice note taking software
	but for some reason the tab is always glitching on me unfortunately

I do enjoy using it because it is a native linux app and it is not notion. I definitely like that the app is not trying to hijack my text cursor like neovim was that was honestly unbearable

I need to try and catch up on homework but at the same time i need to work on getting my life together. thankfully i was able to get the toilet fixed which is a lot off of my mental stack and i was able to get the part ordered that is hopefully going to fix the car. i am going to take it by in the morning and hopefully they will get that taken care of and my car can be a lot safer on the road and we can get to and from work safely and efficiently. i need to get my productivity software in check because right now everything is way too fragmented. I could use obsidian for everything but it is not accessible on my iphone without proper syncing. I could move over to notion full time but I don't exactly like how there is ai integrated directly into the note taking app it is a bit much
