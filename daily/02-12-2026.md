# Notes from Pioneer Phone

To be honest I am just not that interested in this role because I honestly do not want to try and do an internship while i have all my kids i just cant manage that kind of commitment right now.

So instead, I will listen to the questions and just be interested in applying one day when I graduate and the kids are in school!!

In case he does call on me I think I will ask

What is the technology stack that you guys are hiring for? What types of experience are you looking for in a new employee.
- Already mentioned: 
	- C# SQL

This seems like a way for them to get young talent that they can minimize risk with.

Use the data to make a chart that shows the same information as the first chart but in a different style/design. You shouldn't need to manipulate the data any. Just make a new chart that looks different than the one on the first tab but still shows the same information.
