i know that i am supposed to be programming a job application tracker that is fullstack and i was supposed to do a load balancer minecraft server but suddenly i feel more compelled to make my own story video game at this point. i want to make my own story

What if i wrote a book


There was a master and an apprentice

- First character, master
What happened to the master
	Well what happened to me?
		I was born, but not raised by my parents
		The grandparents that raised me died
		I was adopted by someone else
		I can turn that into somewhat of a different type of story

Born by addicts, but by a fantasy drug of some sort
