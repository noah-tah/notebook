Today is the day we will actually be productive. We had somewhat of a decent sleep. I should focus on trying to work as fast as i can with AI and i should stop trying to do things the old school way. I need to use every tool to my advantage I have more than just me to worry about. I will cover knowledge gaps by just working harder.
