It could honestly be interesting to try out new linux distributions in virtualbox since i am getting so much experience using it. it is kinda cool, and i can find something that I really enjoy using perhaps. I should probably just do all my serious programming on windows though. I don't mind leaving arch on my laptop for now though because I somehow have to figure out how to move it from a MBR to the partition scheme that Windows 11 supports. I cannot remember if its called EFI, NTFS, or what.

I actually really enjoy the keyboard from amazon basics it is really really quiet and smooth feeling when I type. When I was typing on the keychron it almost felt like a plastic scraping when it was hitting the keyboard. This one feels luxurious and I feel like i could type on it for a long time.
