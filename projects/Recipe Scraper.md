I want to write an app that scans the page and rips out the recipe and saves it into my obsidian repository.

What technology is capable of doing something like this?
What you want is **very doable** — you’re basically building a  
👉 _“recipe scraper + cleaner + markdown exporter”_.

There are 3 main pieces of tech involved:

---

# 1️⃣ Page scraping (getting the content)

This depends on how robust you want it.

### ✅ Simple approach (works for many sites)

Use an HTML parser:

- **Python**
    
    - `requests` → fetch page
        
    - `BeautifulSoup` → parse HTML
        
- **Node.js**
    
    - `axios` / `fetch`
        
    - `cheerio` (jQuery-style HTML parser)
        

This works if the recipe is already in the HTML.

---

### ✅ Stronger approach (handles dynamic sites)

Use a headless browser:

- **Playwright** (best modern option)
    
- **Puppeteer**
    
- **Selenium**
    

These load the page like a real browser, so you can:

- wait for content to render
    
- click “jump to recipe”
    
- scroll if needed
    
- then extract the HTML
    

👉 If you want reliability, **Playwright is the move**.

---

# 2️⃣ Recipe extraction (the REAL problem)

Most recipe sites bury the recipe in garbage:

- life story
    
- ads
    
- popups
    
- unrelated images
    

You don’t want scraping.  
You want **content extraction**.

### 🔥 Best solution: Structured data parsing

Most recipe sites include hidden JSON like:

```
<script type="application/ld+json">
{
  "@type": "Recipe",
  "name": "...",
  "recipeIngredient": [...]
}
</script>
```

You can parse this and get:

- title
    
- ingredients
    
- steps
    
- cook time
    
- servings
    

👉 This is the **gold standard** solution.

---

### Alternative extraction tools

Libraries that try to detect “main content”:

- **Mozilla** Readability.js
    
- Mercury Parser
    
- Goose Extractor
    

These are decent fallback options if structured data isn’t present.

---

# 3️⃣ Exporting to your Obsidian vault

Since **Obsidian** uses plain Markdown, this part is easy.

Your app can:

1. Convert recipe → Markdown template
    

Example:

```md
# Spaghetti Carbonara

## Ingredients
- 200g spaghetti
- 2 eggs
- pancetta

## Instructions
1. Boil pasta
2. Cook pancetta
3. Mix eggs + cheese
4. Combine

## Source
https://example.com/recipe
```

2. Save directly into:
    

```
/YourVault/Recipes/Spaghetti Carbonara.md
```

That’s it — Obsidian instantly sees it.

Which direction do you want to go first?**




Cookbook.io
- Scrapes recipe from website, cutting out life story and ads only keeping recipe, saves it to database. Application queries database and displays recipes on demand. To avoid legal trouble in the database schema i will make sure to take note of the author and the proper accreditation's. Is this legal? I am certain that it is technically feasible. I think that you could even use AI to determine what parts are life story and what parts are recipe in order to make the scraping more accurate.

Short answer: **it can be legal, but only if you design it carefully.**  
There are **3 separate legal layers** here — copyright, terms of service, and database use.

---

## 1. Copyright law (the big one)

According to the U.S. Copyright Office:

- **Ingredient lists are NOT copyrightable**
    
- **Basic instructions are often not protected**
    
- **Creative expression _is_ protected**
    

That means:

### ✅ Usually safe

- Ingredient lists
    
- Basic steps rewritten in your own words
    
- Cook times, temperatures, quantities
    
- Your own formatting/structure
    
- AI-generated paraphrase of instructions
    

### ❌ Risky / illegal

- Copy-pasting recipe text verbatim
    
- Copying personal story sections
    
- Copying distinctive phrasing or descriptions
    
- Storing full scraped pages in your DB
    

**Key rule:**  
👉 Facts = free  
👉 Expression = protected

So your idea **only storing the actual recipe content** is good —  
but you should **rewrite it**, not store the original text.

---

## 2. Website Terms of Service (often ignored, but important)

Many recipe sites (like Allrecipes and food blogs) explicitly forbid:

- scraping
    
- automated extraction
    
- storing their content
    
- building a competing database
    

Violating ToS is usually **civil breach of contract**, not criminal —  
but they _can_:

- block you
    
- send cease-and-desist
    
- sue if you commercialize it
    

**Safer approaches:**

- Only scrape sites that allow it
    
- Respect robots.txt
    
- Provide source links
    
- Let users import recipes themselves
    

---

## 3. Attribution does NOT make copying legal

This part is super important:

👉 Giving credit **does not fix copyright infringement**

You can’t copy text and say  
“Recipe by Jane Doe”  
and assume you’re safe.

Attribution only matters if:

- the content is public domain, OR
    
- licensed for reuse (like Creative Commons)
    

---

## 4. AI extraction idea — legally interesting

Using AI to:

- detect recipe sections
    
- rewrite instructions
    
- normalize ingredient formats
    

This actually helps your legal position.

If your system:

1. extracts structure
    
2. paraphrases content
    
3. stores normalized recipe data
    

then your DB becomes a **transformed dataset**, not a copied one.

That’s much safer.

---

## 5. Safest architecture (what I’d do)

If you want Cookbook.io to be legally solid:

### Store in DB:

- Ingredients (normalized text)
    
- Steps rewritten/paraphrased
    
- Prep/cook time
    
- Nutrition if available
    
- Source URL
    
- Author name
    

### Do NOT store:

- original paragraphs
    
- photos
    
- personal stories
    
- site formatting
    
- comments/reviews
    

### On frontend:

Show:

> “Adapted from [source link]”

This is the safest common pattern used by:

- recipe apps
    
- grocery planners
    
- meal prep tools
    

---

## 6. Bottom line

✔ Technically feasible — absolutely  
✔ Legally possible — yes  
⚠ Only if you **transform**, not copy

---

If you want, I can also outline:

- a **legally safe DB schema**
    
- a **scraper → AI → normalized recipe pipeline**
    
- or a **minimal MVP architecture** you could build this semester
    

Which do you want next?


URL
 ↓
HTML fetcher
 ↓
DOM parser
 ↓
Recipe candidate extractor (rules + heuristics)
 ↓
Structured text bundle
 ↓
AI normalization pass
 ↓
Validated recipe object
 ↓
Database


You’re thinking in exactly the right direction.  
A **scraper → AI → normalized recipe pipeline** is basically a multi-stage text processing system where each stage makes the data cleaner and more structured.

Here’s what a practical version looks like for a dev like you.

---

# 1. High-level architecture

```
URL
 ↓
HTML fetcher
 ↓
DOM parser
 ↓
Recipe candidate extractor (rules + heuristics)
 ↓
Structured text bundle
 ↓
AI normalization pass
 ↓
Validated recipe object
 ↓
Database
```

Each stage has a clear job. No magic. Just pipelines.

---

# 2. Stage 1 — Fetcher (boring but important)

Goal: get raw HTML reliably.

Typical stack:

- Node: `axios` / `node-fetch`
    
- Python: `requests`
    
- Add headers to look like a real browser
    
- Cache responses locally (huge for development)
    

Output:

```
raw_html
```

---

# 3. Stage 2 — DOM parser

Goal: turn HTML into searchable structure.

Typical tools:

- Node: `cheerio`
    
- Python: `BeautifulSoup`
    
- Browser extension: real DOM
    

Output:

```
document tree
```

Now you can search for:

- `<ul>` lists
    
- `<li>`
    
- `<p>`
    
- `<h2>`
    
- `<section>`
    
- JSON-LD blocks (important!)
    

---

# 4. Stage 3 — Recipe candidate extraction (RULES, not AI)

This is where most of the work happens.

You want to detect:

### A. Ingredient section clues

Look for headings containing:

```
ingredients
what you'll need
for the sauce
for the dough
```

Then grab:

```
the next <ul> or block of <li>
```

---

### B. Instruction section clues

Headings like:

```
instructions
directions
method
steps
preparation
```

Then grab:

```
the next <ol> or group of paragraphs
```

---

### C. Time / yield detection

Regex works well:

```
/prep.*?(\d+)/i
/cook.*?(\d+)/i
/serves?.*?(\d+)/i
```

---

### D. THE SECRET WEAPON: JSON-LD structured data

Many recipe sites embed this:

```html
<script type="application/ld+json">
{
 "@type": "Recipe",
 "recipeIngredient": [...],
 "recipeInstructions": [...]
}
</script>
```

If present, this is gold.  
Use it first before any scraping heuristics.

---

# 5. Stage 4 — Build a structured bundle

At this stage, you’re NOT using AI yet.

You produce something like:

```json
{
  "title": "...",
  "ingredients_raw": [
    "2 cups flour",
    "1 tsp salt"
  ],
  "instructions_raw": [
    "Mix flour and salt...",
    "Bake at 350F..."
  ],
  "time_raw": "...",
  "yield_raw": "...",
  "source_url": "..."
}
```

This is your **scraped candidate object**.

---

# 6. Stage 5 — AI normalization pass (the smart layer)

Now AI becomes useful.

Instead of “rewrite recipe”, you give it a **data cleaning job**.

Prompt example:

```
You are a recipe parser.

Convert this scraped recipe into normalized JSON.

Rules:
- Rewrite instructions in neutral wording
- Standardize units
- Split ingredients into quantity/unit/item fields
- Remove fluff text
- Keep meaning identical
- Return ONLY valid JSON

DATA:
{your scraped object}
```

---

### Output you want:

```json
{
  "title": "Slow Cooker Chicken and Dumplings",
  "ingredients": [
    { "qty": 2, "unit": "cup", "item": "flour" },
    { "qty": 1, "unit": "tsp", "item": "salt" }
  ],
  "steps": [
    "Combine flour and salt in a bowl.",
    "Cook at 350°F for 30 minutes."
  ],
  "prep_time_min": 10,
  "cook_time_min": 30,
  "servings": 4
}
```

Now your DB has **clean, structured recipes**.

---

# 7. Stage 6 — Validation layer (CRITICAL)

Never trust AI output blindly.

You run checks:

- ingredients array not empty
    
- steps > 1
    
- quantities numeric or null
    
- times reasonable
    
- title present
    

If it fails:

```
send to retry queue
```

---

# 8. Stage 7 — Database schema

Normalized tables like:

```
recipes
ingredients
steps
tags
sources
```

This allows:

- search by ingredient
    
- meal planning
    
- grocery lists
    
- nutrition estimation later
    

---

# 9. What your MVP could look like

For you specifically (CS student, backend focus):

### Week 1 MVP

- CLI tool
    
- paste URL
    
- parse JSON-LD
    
- store recipe JSON locally
    

### Week 2

- add heuristic scraping fallback
    
- add AI normalization step
    

### Week 3

- SQLite DB
    
- simple query interface
    

That’s already portfolio-level.

---

# 10. Why this project is actually very strong for your career

Because it demonstrates:

- scraping
    
- parsing messy data
    
- structured pipelines
    
- API integration
    
- DB modeling
    
- reliability thinking
    
- legal awareness
    

This is **real backend engineering**, not toy stuff.

---

If you want, I can next show you:

**A concrete tech stack suggestion tailored to you**  
(Node vs Python vs C++ backend)

or

**A literal file-by-file project structure**

Which do you want?


Alright — tailored to **you specifically** (CS student, backend focus, likes systems/C++, comfortable with Linux/WSL, wants employable skills, not toy stacks).

I’m going to give you **one primary stack** and **one alternate**, and explain _why_.

---

# 🥇 Primary Stack (best for employability + speed)

This stack shows modern backend skills companies actually hire for.

## **Core language: Node.js + TypeScript**

Why this fits you:

- You already know JavaScript
    
- TypeScript teaches real backend discipline
    
- Huge scraping + AI ecosystem
    
- Used everywhere in production
    
- Faster to ship than C++
    

This lets you focus on:

- architecture
    
- data modeling
    
- pipelines
    
- reliability
    

…instead of fighting tooling.

---

## **Scraping Layer**

### Libraries:

- `axios` → HTTP requests
    
- `cheerio` → HTML parsing
    
- `puppeteer` (only if needed for JS-heavy sites)
    

Why:

- Cheerio is basically jQuery for servers
    
- Super fast to learn
    
- Industry standard for scraping
    

---

## **Structured Data Detection**

### Libraries:

- `jsonld` or plain JSON parsing
    
- `zod` → schema validation
    

Why:

- Shows companies you know input validation
    
- Prevents AI garbage from entering DB
    

---

## **AI Layer**

Use:

- OpenAI API (or equivalent)
    

Design pattern:

```
/ai/normalizeRecipe.ts
/ai/prompts/normalize.ts
```

Why:

- keeps prompts versioned
    
- clean separation from scraper
    
- very professional architecture
    

---

## **Backend / Pipeline Orchestrator**

Use:

- plain TypeScript services
    
- no heavy framework initially
    

Structure like:

```
/src
  /fetch
  /extract
  /ai
  /validate
  /db
  /pipeline
```

Why:

- shows you understand service boundaries
    
- looks like real production code
    

---

## **Database**

### MVP:

👉 SQLite + `better-sqlite3`

### Later upgrade:

👉 PostgreSQL

Why:

- SQLite = zero friction
    
- Postgres = industry standard
    
- Same schema works for both
    

---

## **ORM / Query Layer**

Use:  
👉 `Drizzle ORM`

Why:

- extremely employable
    
- SQL-first (good for backend jobs)
    
- type-safe
    
- much cleaner than Prisma for this use case
    

---

## **API Layer**

Later stage:

👉 `Fastify`

Why:

- faster than Express
    
- modern
    
- used in real production
    
- teaches good backend patterns
    

---

## **Testing**

Use:

- `Vitest`
    

Why:

- simple
    
- fast
    
- TS-native
    
- companies like seeing tests
    

---

# 🧠 What this stack signals to employers

If they see this repo, they think:

> “This person understands modern backend architecture.”

It demonstrates:

- pipeline thinking
    
- schema design
    
- input validation
    
- async workflows
    
- structured services
    
- AI integration
    
- DB modeling
    

That’s resume gold.

---

# 🥈 Alternate Stack (if you want to lean systems-heavy)

If you want something that aligns with your **C++ / backend systems goal**:

---

## **Core language: Python**

Why:

- best scraping ecosystem
    
- best AI tooling
    
- widely used in data pipelines
    
- very employable backend/data skill
    

---

### Python stack:

- `requests` → fetching
    
- `BeautifulSoup` / `lxml` → parsing
    
- `pydantic` → schema validation
    
- `sqlite3` / PostgreSQL
    
- `FastAPI` → API layer
    

This stack is:

- extremely common in data engineering
    
- used in AI companies
    
- used in backend tooling
    

---

# 🧭 My honest recommendation for YOU

Given your goals:

- you want a stable backend job
    
- you already know JS
    
- you want something portfolio-worthy
    
- you want to ship quickly
    

👉 **Use TypeScript stack first**

You’ll finish faster  
It’ll look stronger on GitHub  
It’s easier to demo  
It aligns with modern hiring

Then later:  
👉 build a second version in C++ or Python for systems cred.

That’s the power move.
