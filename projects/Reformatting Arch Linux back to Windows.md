I had to pause this project so that I could focus on getting work done because I do not want to fall behind on my school work at this time for figuring this out. For now I will just fix my hyprland config and stick with arch for a while longer. I can spin up a  windows virtual machine pretty easily, i already did it, so I can do my tableau homework after I catch up on Information Security.

The reason I was not able to install on the hard drive was because it is using a Master Boot Record (MBR) partition scheme. I went down two different rabbit holes:

1. Installing Drivers within the Windows Install Screen that will allow me to format the Hard Drive?
2. Launching into Windows via a Boot Drive and changing it that way?z
