Concurrency control is a DBMS feature that coordinates the simultaneous execution of transactions in a multiprocessing database system while preserving data integrity
	the objective is to ensure serializability of transactions in a multi user database environment
concurrency control is important because the simultaneous execution of transactions over a shared database can create several data integrity and consistency problems
the three main problems are lost updates, uncommitted data, and inconsistent retrievals
