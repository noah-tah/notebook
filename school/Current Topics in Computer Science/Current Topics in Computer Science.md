W- A robot that moves around with sensors and navigation systems are called autonomous mobile robots
- An AI algorithm is an advanced set of machine instructions that improve over time

A language model learned from text it has collected and it CAN produce original text by predicting the next word in a text response
	- Can recognize voice, optical characters, and handwriting 
	- Optical character recognizer
		- OCR software created text
did a lot of showing for the cattle
	played rock n roll for the cattle because it made it easier for the animals to adjust to the loud show



Providing Clear Instructions
- Be explicit and concise
	- if you want a short answer, ask for it
	- if you need expert-level writing, specify that you need a detailed, professional

Adopting a Persona
- Chat models by default typically provide a professional and friendly tone in their generic responses
- You can encourage the AI model to adopt a specific persona or tone
	- you can instruct it to respond as a poet, scientist, marketing professional, or even a fictional character

Defining the Output Format
- When you enter a chat bot prompt, you can detail the format of the output
	- you could as for:
		- bulleted or numbered list
		- paragraph
		- quiz
		- email
		- specific language
		- certain number of words
		- summary
		- coding snippets in different programming languages
		- a table format


Targeting your audience
	- Tailor prompts to your target audience to obtain the best result
		- Students may want a summary, business professionals may want to investigate sales statistics
	- Knowing your audience will you manage complexity in language and word jargon
		- Using technical jargon such as API 

Crafting Social Media Marketing Campaign Prompts
- Many businesses use social media to communicate directly with customers
	- builds brand recognition and trust
	- enables businesses to highlight their products or services with fun, engaging content to create more sales
	- supports two-way communication
	- helps build a community around a brand, fostering trust and connection.

Creating Research and Analysis Prompts
	AI is shifting the way businesses conduct research and analysis, empowering them to make data-driven decisions
		may uncover hidden trends
		can analyze vast amounts of random review data
		may find recurring commends and patterns that humans might miss

Generating Code with Prompts
	In today's world, almost every business needs a website, a mobile app, a database to store information, and other systems
	each of these computer systems can be modified to develop custom software solutions or integrate with existing technologies
		even with basic coding knowledge, employees can customize the platform and solve problems without relying on external developers
	generative AI can generate code in almost any programming language including Java, Python, and C#


Making Sure Generative AI Gets Smarter
	ChatGPT is trained using reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) which combines reinforcement learning techniques, such as rewards and comparisons, with human guidance and feedback
	Over time, ChatGPT uses RLHF to learn to avoid common pitfalls and generate more appropriate responses to your requests


Evaluating the Effects of AI on Privacy
	One of the most important principles of any company is creating a brand that is associated with the values of trust and privacy
	Businesses must understand the implications of the use of AI and how to employ these tools for good
	The misuse of AI's ability to generate human-quality text undermines the core principles of academic integrity, learning, and original thought.
		Privacy in AI is also a major concern
			AI systems often require large amounts of data, raising questions about data collection practices and how long data is retained.
