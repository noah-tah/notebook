W- A robot that moves around with sensors and navigation systems are called autonomous mobile robots
- An AI algorithm is an advanced set of machine instructions that improve over time

A language model learned from text it has collected and it CAN produce original text by predicting the next word in a text response
	- Can recognize voice, optical characters, and handwriting 
	- Optical character recognizer
		- OCR software created text
did a lot of showing for the cattle
	played rock n roll for the cattle because it made it easier for the animals to adjust to the loud show



Providing Clear Instructions
- Be explicit and concise
	- if you want a short answer, ask for it
	- if you need expert-level writing, specify that you need a detailed, professional

Adopting a Persona
- Chat models by default typically provide a professional and friendly tone in their generic responses
- You can encourage the AI model to adopt a specific persona or tone
	- you can instruct it to respond as a poet, scientist, marketing professional, or even a fictional character

Defining the Output Format
- When you enter a chat bot prompt, you can detail the format of the output
	- you could as for:
		- bulleted or numbered list
		- paragraph
		- quiz
		- email
		- specific language
		- certain number of words
		- summary
		- coding snippets in different programming languages
		- a table format


Targeting your audience
	- Tailor prompts to your target audience to obtain the best result
		- Students may want a summary, business professionals may want to investigate sales statistics
	- Knowing your audience will you manage complexity in language and word jargon
		- Using technical jargon such as API 

Crafting Social Media Marketing Campaign Prompts
- Many businesses use social media to communicate directly with customers
	- builds brand recognition and trust
	- enables businesses to highlight their products or services with fun, engaging content to create more sales
	- supports two-way communication
	- helps build a community around a brand, fostering trust and connection.

Creating Research and Analysis Prompts
	AI is shifting the way businesses conduct research and analysis, empowering them to make data-driven decisions
		may uncover hidden trends
		can analyze vast amounts of random review data
		may find recurring commends and patterns that humans might miss

Generating Code with Prompts
	In today's world, almost every business needs a website, a mobile app, a database to store information, and other systems
	each of these computer systems can be modified to develop custom software solutions or integrate with existing technologies
		even with basic coding knowledge, employees can customize the platform and solve problems without relying on external developers
	generative AI can generate code in almost any programming language including Java, Python, and C#


Making Sure Generative AI Gets Smarter
	ChatGPT is trained using reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) which combines reinforcement learning techniques, such as rewards and comparisons, with human guidance and feedback
	Over time, ChatGPT uses RLHF to learn to avoid common pitfalls and generate more appropriate responses to your requests


Evaluating the Effects of AI on Privacy
	One of the most important principles of any company is creating a brand that is associated with the values of trust and privacy
	Businesses must understand the implications of the use of AI and how to employ these tools for good
	The misuse of AI's ability to generate human-quality text undermines the core principles of academic integrity, learning, and original thought.
		Privacy in AI is also a major concern
			AI systems often require large amounts of data, raising questions about data collection practices and how long data is retained.

2.5 Using Deep Learning in Microsoft Office with Copilot

- Currently, machine learning, deep learning, and other AI technologies continue to evolve in a multitude of technology apps
- Copilot for Microsoft 365 is fueled by deep learning technologies
	- Acts like a virtual assistance to help you with your work in several ways throughout the Microsoft 365 suit of apps
- Copilot can be used to generate ideas to assist in creating a business plan
	- Brainstorming the target audience
	- Crafting a compelling mission statement
	- Creating a motivational email
- Copilot can save time by analyzing your text and offering multiple rewrite suggestions
- Copilot takes into account the surrounding text (the context) and the overall topic when generating suggestions
- The copilot pane can assist in reviewing documents by:
	- summarizing documents with ease
	- providing concise bullets
	- creating custom types of documents
- I also enjoy bullets, Mr. Bagley likes bullets
	- we are bullet enjoyers
- Facebook or YouTube video
- Copilot within PowerPoint can also turn ideas into a designed presentation based on AI prompts
	- You can use Copilot recommendations or choose from PowerPoint's slide layouts and presentation themes to tailor your presentation
	- Once you type a prompt, Copilot suggests wording and a flow for your presentation, making sure your ideas are clear to your audience
- Copilot within PowerPoint takes your concept from the AI prompt you enter and then searches the Web, gathering relevant information to construct a presentation tailored to your needs
- You can start from scratch or upload an existing file such as a Word document to use as the basis of the presentation

- You can do PowerPoint slides with Copilot


- Commercial data protection is common in most businesses when it comes to securing your company's information
	- Commercial data protection is the practice of safeguarding sensitive business information
- Copilot might be a safer and more secure option than ChatGPT because it provides:
	- Data privacy and control
	- Company security measures
	- Support and service
- Copilot wants to be a part of your daily life
	- ChatGPT wants to be queried 


- AGI refers to a type of artificial intelligence that can understand, learn, and apply knowledge in a way that is indistinguishable from human intelligence
	- Different from the Turing test as it measures whether AI can solve multiple problems in new situations instead of just focusing on one

Genius's are better at exploring than they are at coming up with a new idea?
	Ideal: 120-145
		Come up with new ideas
		Hire the other geniuses to do the work for them

WITH AI IT IS HARD TO PROVE IF ANYONE UNDERSTANDS THE UNDERLYING  CONCEPTS

- Age of Radicalism?
	- In depth study of subject matter
- Lots of Americans have given up their brain
- Do not get in the way of Police
	- But it is good to picket 
- Police officers or Border Patrol
	- Most likely to be killed in America
		- Regularly have to defend themselves and are on edge at all times and are more likely to attack in situations

- AI is reshaping the business economy and altering the workforce
- Entire industries are starting to shift from a human-based workforce ti AI-based services
- AI chatbots can be used to simulate having a conversation with a virtual assistant on a website or messaging app
	- Chatbots can still struggle with complex or hard-to-understand questions
	- They cannot replicate human emotions or empathy

- Claude AI for coding

- In the AI age of information, businesses are focusing on data
- Data helps business leaders interpret underlying trends to understand what products their customers are interested in now and into the future
- Scenario with AI Data
	- AI algorithms analyze browsing behavior
	- Advertisers use data to target users with relevant ads
# Opportunities and Concerns with the New AI-Based Economy
- The vast amount of private data collected about everyone has significant positive and negative implications
- Collecting AI data can be used to recognize unusual patterns
	- AI can help stop fraudulent transactions
- AI-powered security cameras can distinguish between familiar and unfamiliar faces and detect unusual activity
	- they can prevent potential break-ins

Think about how AI has evolved throughout the decades
	prior to reading this chapters, what did you know about the innovations involved in the evolution of AI?
	Which concepts were completely new to you?
