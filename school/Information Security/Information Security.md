CNSS Security Model

- Information System
	- A combination of the software, hardware, people, procedures and networks that comes together to perform a business function using information
		- Each has unique security requirements
	

 System admins typically work to improve the security of their information systems
	- this is advantageous in one way because it leads to system admins with a high level of technical expertise
	- The downside of this is that it lacks community support
	- it also lacks organizational staying power

- Make sure that the money goes with the authority and security

Another approach to implementing information security:
	- Could be initiated by upper management
		- Policies
		- Procedures
		- Processes
	- They will make sure those that are performing actions are held accountable 
	- Make sure the expected outcomes are known, and goals are known
