- Although it might seem counterintuitive, the goal of InfoSec is not to bring residual risk to zero; rather, it is to bring residual risk in line with an organization’s risk appetite. If decision makers have been informed of uncontrolled risks and the proper authority groups within the communities of interest decide to leave residual risk in place, then the InfoSec program has accomplished its primary goal.

- When a vulnerability (flaw or weakness) exists in an important asset—Implement security controls to reduce the likelihood of a vulnerability being exploited.
- When a vulnerability can be exploited—Apply layered protections, architectural designs, and administrative controls to minimize the risk or prevent the occurrence of an attack.
- When the attacker’s potential gain is greater than the costs of attack—Apply protections to increase the attacker’s cost or reduce the attacker’s gain by using technical or managerial controls. Note that the attacker’s potential gain is considered from his or her perspective, not the organization’s, so the latter’s perceived potential loss could be much smaller than the attacker’s potential gain.
- When the potential loss is substantial—Apply design principles, architectural designs, and technical and nontechnical protections to limit the extent of the attack, thereby reducing the potential for loss.

Cost Avoidance
- The financial savings from using the mitigation risk treatment strategy to implement a control and eliminate the financial ramifications of an incident.

Cost Benefit Analysis (CBA)
- The formal assessment and presentation of the economic expenditures needed for a particular security control, contrasted with its projected value to the organization; also known as an economic feasibility study.

Cost
- Cost of development or acquisition—Hardware, software, and services
- Training fees—Cost to train personnel
- Cost of implementation—Installing, configuring, and testing hardware, software, and services
- Service costs—Vendor fees for maintenance and upgrades or from outsourcing the information asset’s protection and/or insurance
- Cost of maintenance—Labor expense to verify and continually test, maintain, train, and update
- Potential cost from the loss of the asset—Either from removal of service (termination) or compromise by attack 

Asset valuation
- The process of assigning financial value or worth to each information asset.
	- Value retained from the cost of creating the information asset
		Value retained from past maintenance of the information asset
		Value implied by the cost of replacing the information
		Value from providing the information
		Value acquired from the cost of protecting the information
		Value to owners
		Value of intellectual property
		Value to adversaries
		Loss of productivity while the information assets are unavailable
		Loss of revenue while information assets are unavailable
		Total cost of ownership 


single loss expectancy (SLE)
	In a cost-benefit analysis, the calculated value associated with the most likely loss from an attack (impact); the SLE is the product of the asset’s value and the exposure factor.

annualized rate of occurrence (ARO)
	In a cost-benefit analysis, the expected frequency of an attack, expressed on a per-year basis.


annualized loss expectancy (ALE)
	In a cost-benefit analysis, the product of the annualized rate of occurrence and single loss expectancy.
