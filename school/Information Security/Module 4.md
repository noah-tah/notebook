- Although it might seem counterintuitive, the goal of InfoSec is not to bring residual risk to zero; rather, it is to bring residual risk in line with an organization’s risk appetite. If decision makers have been informed of uncontrolled risks and the proper authority groups within the communities of interest decide to leave residual risk in place, then the InfoSec program has accomplished its primary goal.

- When a vulnerability (flaw or weakness) exists in an important asset—Implement security controls to reduce the likelihood of a vulnerability being exploited.
- When a vulnerability can be exploited—Apply layered protections, architectural designs, and administrative controls to minimize the risk or prevent the occurrence of an attack.
- When the attacker’s potential gain is greater than the costs of attack—Apply protections to increase the attacker’s cost or reduce the attacker’s gain by using technical or managerial controls. Note that the attacker’s potential gain is considered from his or her perspective, not the organization’s, so the latter’s perceived potential loss could be much smaller than the attacker’s potential gain.
- When the potential loss is substantial—Apply design principles, architectural designs, and technical and nontechnical protections to limit the extent of the attack, thereby reducing the potential for loss.

Cost Avoidance
- The financial savings from using the mitigation risk treatment strategy to implement a control and eliminate the financial ramifications of an incident.

Cost Benefit Analysis (CBA)
- The formal assessment and presentation of the economic expenditures needed for a particular security control, contrasted with its projected value to the organization; also known as an economic feasibility study.

Cost
- Cost of development or acquisition—Hardware, software, and services
- Training fees—Cost to train personnel
- Cost of implementation—Installing, configuring, and testing hardware, software, and services
- Service costs—Vendor fees for maintenance and upgrades or from outsourcing the information asset’s protection and/or insurance
- Cost of maintenance—Labor expense to verify and continually test, maintain, train, and update
- Potential cost from the loss of the asset—Either from removal of service (termination) or compromise by attack 

Asset valuation
- The process of assigning financial value or worth to each information asset.
Value retained from the cost of creating the information asset—Information is created or acquired at a cost, which can be calculated or estimated. Software development costs include the efforts of the many people involved in the systems development life cycle for each application and system. Although this effort draws mainly on IT personnel, it also includes the user and general management community and sometimes the InfoSec staff. In today’s marketplace, with high programmer salaries and even higher contractor expenses, the average cost to complete even a moderately sized application can quickly escalate.

Value retained from past maintenance of the information asset—It is estimated that between 60 and 80 percent of the total cost of acquiring (or developing) and operating an information asset is incurred in the maintenance phase. That typically means for every dollar spent on developing an application or acquiring and processing data, another $3 to $5 will be spent after the software is in use. If actual costs have not been recorded, the cost can be estimated in terms of the human resources required to continually update, support, modify, and service the applications and systems.

Value implied by the cost of replacing the information—The costs associated with replacing information should include the human and technical resources needed to reconstruct, restore, or regenerate the information from backups, independent transaction logs, or even hard copies of data sources. Most organizations rely on routine media backups to protect their information. When estimating recovery costs, keep in mind that you may have to hire contractors to carry out the regular workload that employees will be unable to perform during recovery efforts. To restore this information, the various information sources may have to be reconstructed, with the data reentered into the system and validated for accuracy.

Value from providing the information—Separate from the cost of developing or maintaining the information is the cost of providing the information to users who need it. Such costs include the values associated with the delivery of the information through hardware and software systems, databases, and networks. They also include the cost of the infrastructure necessary to provide access to and control of the information, including the personnel costs associated with it.

Value acquired from the cost of protecting the information—The value of an asset is based in part on the cost of protecting it, and the amount of money spent to protect an asset is based in part on the value of the asset. While this is a seemingly unending circle, estimating the value of protecting an information asset can help you better understand the expense associated with its potential loss. The values listed previously are easy to calculate with some precision. This value and those that follow are likely to be estimates of cost.

Value to owners—How much is your Social Security number worth to you? Or your bank account number? Although it may be impossible for organizations to estimate the value of their information or what portion of revenue is directly attributable to it, they must understand the overall costs that could result from its loss so they realize its true value. Here again, estimating value may be the only method possible.

Value of intellectual property—The value of a new product or service to a customer may ultimately be unknowable. How much would a cancer patient pay for a cure? How much would a shopper pay for a new flavor of cheese? What is the value of a logo or advertising slogan? Related but separate are intellectual properties known as trade secrets. Intellectual information assets are the primary assets of some organizations.

Value to adversaries—How much is it worth to an organization to know what the competition is doing? Many organizations have established departments tasked with the assessment and estimation of the activities of their competition. Even organizations in traditionally nonprofit industries can benefit from knowing what is going on in political, business, and competitive organizations. Stories are common of how disgruntled employees steal information and present it to competitive organizations to curry favor and get new jobs. Those who hire such applicants to gain from their larceny should consider whether benefiting from such a tactic is wise. After all, such thieves could presumably repeat their activities when they become disgruntled with their new employers.

Loss of productivity while the information assets are unavailable—When a network (or Internet) outage occurs, users may be able to access local but not remote data, hindering their productivity. Although this is not an example of an attack that damages information, it is an instance in which a threat affects an organization’s productivity. (This threat is known as deviations in quality of service from service providers, as shown in Table 4-4.) The hours of wasted employee time, the cost of using alternatives, and the general lack of productivity will incur costs and can severely set back a critical operation or process.

Loss of revenue while information assets are unavailable—Have you ever been purchasing something at a retail store and your payment card could not be read by the card terminal? How many times did you try using the card before the clerk had to enter the numbers manually, if they could? How long did it take to enter the numbers manually in contrast to the quick swipe? What if the payment card verification process was offline? Did the organization even have a manual process to validate or process payment card transactions in the absence of the electronic approval system, or did they just assert a “cash only” policy? Most organizations have all but abandoned manual backups for automated processes, and many would be unable to conduct business if certain information was unavailable.
