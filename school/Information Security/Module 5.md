adverse events
	An event with negative consequences that could threaten the organization’s information assets or operations; also referred to as an incident candidate.

contingency planning (CP)
- The actions taken by senior management to specify the organization’s efforts and actions if an adverse event becomes an incident or disaster; CP typically includes incident response, disaster recovery, and business continuity efforts, as well as preparatory business impact analysis.
	- Consists of four major components:
		- Business impact analysis (BIA)
		- Incident response plan (IR) plan)
		- Disaster recovery plan (DR plan)
		- Business continuity plan (BC plan)
- What communities of interest are associated with contingency planning?
	- contingency planning management team (CPMT)
		- consists of four teams to manage each part of the plan:
			- incident response planning team
			- disaster recovery planning team
			- business continuity planning team
			- crisis management planning team
	- This could also be interpreted as the two communities of interest: the Information Security/Information Technology and the Senior Management Community. The Senior Management community would oversee the process.

contingency planning management team (CPMT)
	The group of senior managers and project members organized to conduct and lead all CP efforts.

**NIST framework** - seven-step approach to implementing or improving their risk management and security programs:
- Step 1 - Prioritize and scope
	- The organization identifies its business/mission objectives and high-level organizational priorities. With this information, the organization makes strategic decisions regarding cybersecurity implementations and determines the scope of systems and assets that support the selected business line or process
- Step 2 - Orient
	- Once the scope of the cybersecurity program has been determined for the business line or process, the organization identifies related systems and assets, regulatory requirements, and overall risk approach. The organization then identifies threats to, and vulnerabilties of, those systems and asset.
- Step 3 - Create a current profile
	- The organization develops a current profile by indicated which category and subcategory outcomes from the framework core are currently being achieved.
- Step 4 - Conduct a risk assessment
	- This assessment could be guided by the organization’s overall risk management process or previous risk assessment activities. The organization analyzes the operational environment in order to discern the likelihood of a cybersecurity event and the impact that the event could have on the organization. 
- Step 5 - Create a target profile
	- The organization creates a target profile that focuses on the assessment of the framework categories and subcategories describing the organization’s desired cybersecurity outcomes. 
- Step 6 - Determine, analyze, and prioritize gaps
	- The organization compares the current profile and the target profile to determine gaps. Next it creates a prioritized action plan to address those gaps that draws upon mission drivers, a cost-benefit analysis, and understanding of risk to achieve the outcomes in the target profile. The organization then determines resources necessary to address the gaps. 
- Step 7 - Implement action plan
	- The organization determines which actions to take in regards to the gaps, if any, identified in the previous step. It then monitors its current cybersecurity practices against the target profile
