		- Business impact analysis (BIA)
		- Incident response plan (IR) plan)
		- Disaster recovery plan (DR plan)
		- Business continuity plan (BC plan)

	- contingency planning management team (CPMT)
		- consists of four teams to manage each part of the plan:
			- incident response planning team
			- disaster recovery planning team
			- business continuity planning team

- To ensure continuity during the creation of the CP components, a seven-step process is used:
	1. Develop the contingency planning policy statement. A formal policy provides guidance.
	2. Conduct the BIA. Prioritize information systems and components critical to supporting the organization.
	3. Identify preventive controls. Reduce the effects of system distruptions, increasing system availability.
	4. Create contingency strategies. Recovery strategies to efficiently recover the system.
	5. Develop a contingency plan. Procedures for restoring damaged organizational facilities unique to the recovery requirements.
	6. Ensure plan testing, training and exercises. Validate recovery capabilities.
	7. Ensure plan maintenance. Living document that is updated regularly.
